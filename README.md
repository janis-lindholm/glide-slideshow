# glide-slideshow
A simple browser based slideshow powered by [D3.js](http://d3js.org).

**Warning: This software is in early alpha state.**

##Quickstart

Five steps to launch a browser based slideshow:

1. Drop your pictures into the `./pics` subfolder.
2. Create your own `pics.json`. (you can use `pics.example.json` as a template)
3. List pictures in your `pics.json`. This defines the order in which pics are played back.
4. Open the `slideshow.html` file in your web browser. (currently only Firefox is supported)
5. Lean back and watch your slideshow.

##Configuration

All configuration settings are made in the `pics.json` file.
